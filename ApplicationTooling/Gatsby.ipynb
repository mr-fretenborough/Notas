    "These kinds of websites use static HTML pages that are uploaded to a CDN or web host. However, these kinds of websites are hard to update or maintain and each page change requires a fresh request to the server and a subsequent full page refresh. Furthermore, these websites generally don't contain any dynamic data\n",

Moreover, because there is only a single request from the server, it follows that everything else, be it routing or data, is handled by the SPA on the client-side by the browser. This makes websites of this kind easy to update and pretty quick, but the main tradeoff is that they're not search engine optimized as the initial HTML page is empty.\n",

The server uses data & templates from other tools like MongoDB to render the HTML pages. Because a fresh request needs to be made every time a user changes the page, these kinds of applications can be fairly slow. Additionally, the server isn't generally very quick when it reaches out for data to render the page.\n",
