These services communicate with each other by talking over the network and bring many advantages with them. One of the biggest advantages is that they can be deployed independently. However, it offers the opportunity to work with many different technologies.\n","\n","Furthermore, these services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment process. There is a minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.\n","\n","Generally, MSs have their own tech stack, communicate over a combination of REST APIs, event steams, and message brokers, and are organized by business capability (often referred to as bounded context)."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Characteristics\n","\n","Microservices should be small, independent, and loosely coupled such that each service is a seperate codebase that is deployed and maintained by its own team--requiring little interaction with other teams.\n","\n","These MS are also responsible for persisting their own data or external state. \n","\n","They also communicate with each other using well-defined APIs.
